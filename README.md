# ducky
## a repo for wifi based badusb made using a raspberry pi pico /W.
my repo copies [@dbisu's ](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky)pico to ducky converter
basically, the bad usb works by converting my pico to a high speed, automatic, input (like a keyboard)
i will be saving payloads here, and would be updating the adafruit library.

yank the setup repository, add it into your pico, ez.
